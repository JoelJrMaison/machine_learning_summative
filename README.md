# machine_learning_summative
Project on lane line detection

**N/B: due to the size of the dataset, it could not be added into the github repo and it had to be run locally to be able to be deployed**

Link to dataset: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19UiApI3XJHji92ItjtaGeVXQVHJhid1a?usp=sharing 
or https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manideep1108/tusimple

Code was run on VS Code and google colab. 

To run the files locally, the following need to be installed: (preferably using VS code)

- python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip

- .\venv\Scripts\Activate

- pip install opencv-python matplotlib numpy scikit-learn tqdm

- pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 or pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio

For google colab this is the file link:

The dataset was shared and the only thing that needs to be done to access it is to move the dataset from the shared space into the drive by creating a shortcut.
This enables the drive to not be saturated by the database
